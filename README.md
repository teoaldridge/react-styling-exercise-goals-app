# react-styling-exercise-goals-app
In this exercise I practiced different techniques for styling React components. Read more in README.

I did this exercise as part of my studies with React - The Complete Guide (incl Hooks, React Router, Redux) by Maximillian Schwarzmuller

In this exercise I learned and practiced: 
- Setting dynamic inline styles
- Setting CSS Classes dynamically
- Styled Components
- Styled components and dynamic props
- Styled components and media queries
- Using CSS modules
- Dynamic styles with CSS modules

To run locally: 
- Download the project files into a local folder 
- Navigate into this project folder in the terminal 
- In terminal type 'npm install' . This will install the node modules packages and recreates the node_modules folder. 
- In terminal type 'npm start' to start the server and open the project in your browser.
